# Introduction to RubyProjects

I'm exploring Ruby. Herein lie some of my small and likely terrible Ruby projects, written mainly to help me learn and practice the language. I'm primarily a Bourne Shell, BASH, and PERL programmer.

If I some day _git gud_ at Ruby, I'll change the overall 'noob' message of this repository, but for now, even if a program here appears functional and useful, I wouldn't bother using it on your production machines, due to potentially unexpected results.
