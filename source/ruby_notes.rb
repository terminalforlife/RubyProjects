# Safety precaution. This file isn't meant to be executed. Note, however, that
# Ruby let's you use `exit()`, like in PERL, for exiting with a given exit
# status. If this is left empty, it defaults to `0` (success).
#
# Also note that comments in Ruby, like in Shell, Python, and PERL, use the
# hashtag or pound sign ('#').
exit()

# Print a string. The `print()` function (AKA: 'method') does not include a
# new-line character.
print("This is a string.")

# Print a string. The `puts()` function does include a new-line character.
#
# The use of escape sequences works as you'd expect in other languages, and the
# quoting rules appear to be the same as in PERL, sharing similarities with
# Shell.
puts(".")

# If you use `#{NAME}` you can place the contents of the variable within
# double-quotes, thankfully! Some people online will demonstrate this working
# even without '#', but this does not work for me, so is probably for newer or
# older versions of Ruby. This actually works just like `@{[...]}` in PERL, in
# that you can put pretty much anything there.
#
# Note the use of a concatenation symbol, which I believe works like you'd
# expect in JS. In PERL, this is `.`, but that doesn't work here. This operator
# becomes problematic due to the ambiguity when an integer or float is used; -
# in this case, the `to_s()` function can be used, to temperarily convert it to
# a string.
#
# There is also `to_f()` and likely other predictable 'to' functions.
#
# Ruby has the following data types:
#
#   * Array
#   * Boolean
#   * Float
#   * Hash
#   * Integer
#   * Null
#   * String
#
# Variables are not read-only/constant by default.
#
# Unlike standard shells, negative numbers (integer and float) can be used.
#
# Unfortunately, all-lowercase and words seprated by an underscore is the
# standard used in Ruby; I hate this, and think it looks fugly and weird, but
# it's the standard. Ordinarily, I wouldn't care, but it's actually really
# important in Ruby, because there are many reserved words, such as `Array`.
#
# I have no idea how scoping works, yet.
variable = 'Value'
puts('variable is: ' + variable)

# Ruby works in a similar OO way that Python and JS does. In this case, the
# `upcase()` function seems to work exactly like `uc()` in PERL.
puts(variable.upcase())
puts(variable.downcase())

# The handy `strip()` function removes leading and trailing whitespaces and
# tabs, but it also works like `chomp()` in PERL, in that it removes the
# trailing new-line character.
puts(variable.strip())

# The obligatory `length()` function, to return the length of the string. This
# can also be used to get the length of an array; that is, the number of
# indices or elements in the array.
puts(variable.length())

# Ugly as it is, you actually do need that question mark â€” madness! It's a
# handy function though, which allows you to essential perform a simple check
# for a string being within another string, returning a boolean value.
#
# This function can be used on an array to see if an array has an index of the
# given value; very useful. I'm not sure how this would work if you want to
# check for a given index having the given string within it.
puts(variable.include?('Value'))

# Accessing substrings is very easy in Ruby, and does remind me of other
# languages. It's even easier than what you'd ordinarily do in BSH and BASH.
#
# In this example, only the first character is returned. Like other
# languages, `0` is one, and `1` is two.
#
# Even more useful, is the ability to mix the substring with some OO-ness, as
# is demonstrated below, converting and displaying only the 'V' to 'v'.
#
# Like in PERL, ranges are supported using, for example, `0..2`, which in this
# case would display 'Val'. You can use `,` instead of `..` to omit the final
# index, so `0,2` (or `0, 2`) would return `0` and `1`, but not `2`.
#
# You can start from the end of the array by using a negative integer.
puts(variable[0].downcase())

# Erithmetic operations in Ruby works as they do in PERL, and share the usual
# similarities with standard shells.
#
# This also conveniently demonstrates the use of a semi-colon to have Ruby see
# them as new-lines, effectively allowing us to write one-liners, like in
# standard shells.
puts(1 + 1); puts(10 * 2); puts(10 / 2); puts(2 ** 2); puts(10 - 1)

# Return the number rounded up and down, respectively.
#
# I initially wanted to name the variable `Float`, but it was apparently
# already used; I suspect this was because of a same-named class.
floater = 5.5
puts(floater.ceil())
puts(floater.floor())

# Getting input from the user in Ruby is easy, perhaps even more so than in
# PERL, using the `gets()` function (presumably: 'get string').
#
# You don't have to convert it to a string using `to_s()` to avoid an unwanted
# erithmetic operation, because it's of course going to be a string anyway.
#
# I remember being put off by assignment the returned value of a function to a
# variable, years ago. Now, it makes sense and seems practical.
#
# Even more interesting than the use of the `strip()` function, Ruby also has
# a `chomp()` function, which does as the PERL equivalent, but keeps the
# leading and trailing whitespaces and tabs in-tact.
print('PROMPT: ')
Reply = gets().chomp()
puts("You entered: #{Reply}")

# Creating an array is easy enough in Ruby.
#
# If you attempt to return a non-existent index, it'll return `nil`.
#
# Like hashes, the indices can be split up by lines, which is nice to maintain
# sane formatting and overall readability of the code.
random_array = Array[
	'Item_1',
	'Item_2',
	'Item_3'
]

puts('The 2nd index of random_array is: ' + random_array[1])

# Modifying an element/index in an array is as easy as you'd expect in BASH and
# PERL, by simply reassigning the value, specifying the index to reassign.
#
# This would change the 3rd index of `random_array` to 'Item_4' instead of
# 'Item_3'. Pretty straightforward.
#
# This approach can also be used to add new indices to the array.
random_array[2] = 'Item_4'

# Sorting an array in Ruby is as easy as you'd expect in PERL, thankfully.
random_array.sort()

# Making a hash in Ruby is super-simple, just like in PERL. I'm seeing a lot of
# similarities between PERL and Ruby. If anything, it's like Ruby is a
# combination of PERL and Python. This syntax, specfically, is almost as it
# would typically be in PERL.
#
# Although this is obvious for the value, it's worth pointing out that the key
# doesn't have to be a string, but instead can be an integer, float, and even a
# boolean! Possibly others data types.
#
# Ruby supports multidimensional arrays and hashes, like in PERL.
random_hash = {
	'Key_1' => 'Value_1',
	'Key_2' => 'Value_2',
	'Key_3' => [
		'Index_1',
		'Index_2',
		'Index_3'

# Accessing an array index from within a hash is as simple as in PERL. Thanks
# to all my time in PERL and some experimenting in languages like Python, using
# Ruby seems to yield expected results.
puts(random_hash['Key_3'][1])

# The obligatory `printf()` function is available in Ruby, too â€” as if I am
# shocked. It seems to work the same way as in PERL and, presumably, similar to
# the standard shells, with the exception of some of BASH's `printf`
# functionality, of course.
printf("Zero-padded day of the month: %02d\n", 5)

# Defining a function/method is simple in Ruby. It's easy to create positional
# parameters and to even assign a default value. It all seems very easy to use.
def echo(string = 'Empty string.')
	print(string.to_s() + "\n")

	# This could also be used, much as you'd expect in PERL. This would return
	# the value instead of directly printing it to the terminal.
	#
	# Like in PERL, you can provide just the value (any data type) to return
	# (without specifying the `return()` function) on its own.
	#return(string.to_s() + "\n")
end

echo("String given to and printed by the function.")

# A standard `if` statement. Syntax is a bit like VimScript and standard
# shells, but even simpler and quicker to type.
#
# You can also use logical `and` and `or` operators, as in PERL. It does accept
# the `&&` and `||` forms, respectively, also like PERL.
#
# Negation seems to work exactly as in PERL and shells. IE: `!=` or `!` before
# the entire condition.

# Alternative approach to `for` looping, using the `each()` function. It's a

# As in PERL, you need to `close()` your files. There's an alternative method
# of accessing files, which presumably doesn't require manually closing, but I

# using the `split()` function. The result is as expected from PERL, and the
# syntax is like in Python.
#
# As in PERL, making `split()` work on an empty string (not `nil`) will
# actually cause it to split each individual character.

# cleverly determine it should be as such.
